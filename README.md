6.1 (heavy pill) ... Idea problem hard to think of. Interesting solution.

6.2 (probability) ... Easy, not interesting. Think intuitively.

6.3 (dominos) ... "Proof" is based on intuition, but interesting thought.

6.4 (ants walk) ... Trivial problem.


6.9 (100 locks) ... Not easy. Figured out up to the importance of factors.

6.10 (poison) ... Good problem. Should be able to solve next time. Requires CS-like mindset.
