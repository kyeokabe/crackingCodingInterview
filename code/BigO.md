Coders should keep in mind **time** and **space (memory)** complexity when programming.

O(log(N)) ... typical runtime where the number of elements in a problem space gets halved each time (p.44)

O(branch<sup>depth</sup>) ... typical runtime with recursive function that makes multiple calls. (p.45)
