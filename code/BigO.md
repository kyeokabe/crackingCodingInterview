Coders should keep in mind **time** and **space (memory)** complexity when programming.

**time**
O(log(N)) ... typical runtime where the number of elements in a problem space gets halved each time (p.44)

O(branch<sup>depth</sup>) ... typical runtime with recursive function that makes multiple calls. (p.45)

**space**
O(N) ... creating an array of size N

O(N<sup>2</sup>) ... creating an array of size N<sup>2</sup>
